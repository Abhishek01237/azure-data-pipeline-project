# ⚙️ Azure Data Engineering Project: AdventureWorks Pipeline

A complete end-to-end **data engineering pipeline on Azure** built using the **Adventure Works** dataset. This project simulates a mini production-grade data platform using Azure tools like **Data Factory**, **Databricks**, **Data Lake Storage**, **Synapse Analytics**, and **Power BI**.

> 🎯 **Goal:** To understand and implement the data engineering lifecycle on Azure — from ingestion to transformation to visualization.

## 📊 Dataset: Adventure Works

The project uses various datasets from Adventure Works, including:

- `Product`, `Product Category`, `Product Subcategory`
- `Territories`, `Sales (2015–2017)`
- `Return Data`
- `Calendar`

## 📌 Architecture Overview

```plaintext
📁 ADLS (Bronze)         <-  Raw data ingested via ADF
📁 ADLS (Silver)         <-  Cleaned/transformed data via Databricks
📁 ADLS (Gold)           <-  Queried tables served from Synapse
📊 Power BI Report       <-  Connected to Synapse SQL endpoint



### 🔄 Pipeline Flow

1. Data Ingestion – ADF
Built a dynamic pipeline using Lookup and ForEach activities with parameterization to load all datasets sequentially.
Loaded raw CSV data into ADLS Bronze container

2. Data Processing – Databricks (PySpark)

Registered an Azure Service Principal for secure access
Mounted ADLS to Databricks using the SP credentials
Cleaned & transformed data using PySpark
Stored processed data as Parquet files in ADLS Silver


3. Data Serving – Synapse Analytics

Created a serverless SQL pool in Synapse
Created Views over Parquet files stored in Silver
Then defined External Tables using:
External File Format
External Data Source
Credential setup
Stored these external tables in ADLS Gold

4. Visualization – Power BI
Connected Power BI to Synapse SQL endpoint
Built a basic dashboard to test the pipeline
